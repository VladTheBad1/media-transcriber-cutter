# Project Memory

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive local media transcription and editing service that combines AI-powered transcription (WhisperX), video editing, and social media export capabilities. Web-based interface with Next.js frontend and hybrid client/server processing architecture.

## Current State
**Planning Complete** - Comprehensive PRD pack and manifest created
- 6 PRD documents written and registered in manifest
- 6 development lanes with 23 tasks defined
- Starter template analysis completed (mohyware/clip-js primary foundation)
- Ready for agent generation and implementation

## Technology Decisions
**Foundation**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript (based on clip-js template analysis)
**Media Processing**: FFmpeg.wasm (client) + FFmpeg (server) hybrid approach
**Transcription**: WhisperX with Python service bridge
**Database**: SQLite + Prisma ORM (local deployment focus)
**UI**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
**Deployment**: Docker containers for local hosting

**Rationale**: Selected based on proven templates with active maintenance, particularly mohyware/clip-js for video editing foundation and yipy0005/WhisperX-Webapp for transcription patterns.

## Development Phases
**Phase 1**: Foundation (3-5 days) → `lane.foundation`
**Phase 2**: Parallel Development (3-4 weeks) → `lane.media_processing`, `lane.transcription`, `lane.frontend`
**Phase 3**: Advanced Features (4-5 weeks) → `lane.video_editing`, `lane.export` 
**Phase 4**: Integration & Deployment (1 week) → `lane.integration`

**Total Estimated**: 12-16 weeks for complete production-ready system

## Manifest Links (SSOT)
- **PRD Documents**: `prd.architecture@v1`, `prd.requirements@v1`, `prd.api@v1`, `prd.data_model@v1`, `prd.ui_blueprints@v1`, `prd.starter_templates@v1`
- **Development Lanes**: 6 lanes with clear dependencies and parallel execution paths
- **Tasks**: 23 tasks with quality gates and agent assignments
- **Next Ready**: `task.project_setup`, `task.ui_components` can start immediately

## Custom Agents Created
**Pending Creation** - Handoff to agent-generator for:
- nextjs-app-builder, database-architect, api-integration-specialist
- ai-transcription-specialist, media-processing-specialist, ui-component-builder
- timeline-editor-specialist, video-editor-specialist, export-specialist

## Current Session (2025-01-11)
**Completed**: 
- Comprehensive project planning and PRD creation
- Starter template research and analysis (5 templates evaluated)
- System architecture design with hybrid processing approach
- Complete manifest with lanes, tasks, dependencies, and quality gates
- Identified optimal development path using proven templates

**Decisions**:
- Use mohyware/clip-js as primary foundation (0.95 suitability score)
- Integrate WhisperX via Python service for transcription accuracy
- Implement hybrid client/server FFmpeg processing for scalability
- Design for local-only deployment with optional cloud AI features

## Next Steps
1. **Agent Generation**: Deploy agent-generator to create 9 specialist agents
2. **Foundation Lane**: Start with project setup and database schema
3. **Parallel Development**: Begin UI components and media processing simultaneously
4. **Quality Assurance**: Implement comprehensive testing throughout development
